# MISSILE

Welcome and thank you for visiting the MISSILE web development website.  Your input is welcome and encouraged.  You can help by
submitting bugs, improving documentation, improving the code, writing additional modules, etc.  (Please visit the developers guide 
for our philosophy and coding guidelines.)

Modular Install Secure Simple to Implement Lightweight Extensible.

Modular Install - In order to speed up the program as well as minimize the load on your server, only the modules you need are
loaded.  For example, for an e-commerce site chances are you are only using one merchant gateway - why have 20 loaded.  Or, if you
only need a catalogue, why load any gateways.  Some websites need a calendar or schedular, others don't.

Secure - Internet security is critical to any website and we take security seriously.  While one of our primary guilding
principle is minimal, simplified code - security comes first and foremost.  It is better to have a couple extra lines of code to 
insure security.

Simple to Implement - Through a GUI, the end-user answers a series of questions and then the proper modules are pulled and merged,
the database tables are created and then the generated package is uploaded to the server.

Lightweight - While looking at various web platforms, it became obvious that many were bloated.  It seems most platforms try to do
everything.  MISSILE was born to approach this differently by only providing what the end user needs - NO MORE, NO LESS.  In this 
day and age, where consumers are extremely time conscious, they want web pages to load as fast as possible - it is critical to
have a website that is as lightweight as possible so as to be very responsive.  Again, while this is one of our guiding 
principles, this becomes secondary to security.  Therefore, when creating modules, please use efficient, minimal and 
succinct code, but place security first and foremost.

Extensible - MISSILE is intended to grow with you.  Even though it is lightweight, any program should be able to provide years of 
reliable service and expand with you, without letting you down or making you have to change platforms which can be expensive.  In 
fact, being lightweight helps make it extensible.
